New Project with some references from others.

BlackJack_Games

How to use :
1. You'll be drawing some cards with your opponent.
2. If you or you opponent have the total value of cards more than 21, you lost.
3. If you have choose to stand below 21, 
	a. If your opponent hit more than 21, you win.
	b. If your opponent hit less than 21, but higher than you, you lost.
	c. If your opponent hit less than 21, but lower than you, you win.

Issues :
1. The codes are pretty messy.
2. My codes designed to make the bot keep on drawing cards until it's more than 15.
